== README

This is a port of my php blog project, rewritten entirely for ruby on rails. New features include tag search, avatars work on all pages, including comments. 

Each blog now has its own page and can post comments on other blogs. 

Things to do:

- Themes
- Archive Search
- Ability to follow other people
- Dashboard/Feed to see posts from followees

To install and set up you will need Ruby 2 and Rails 4, as well as imagemagick to make use of the paperclip gem.
